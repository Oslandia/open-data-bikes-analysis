#+TITLE: Predict Bike Availability at Bike Sharing Stations
#+AUTHOR: Damien Garaud <damien.garaud@oslandia.com>, Raphaël Delhome <raphael.delhome@oslandia.com>

In a [[http://oslandia.com/en/2017/11/29/cluster-bike-sharing-stations-around-french-cities/][previous article]], we described the clustering of bike sharing stations in
two French cities, /i.e./ Bordeaux and Lyon. We saw that geospatial clustering
is interesting to understand city organization. Results were especially
impressive for the Lyon data set.

Here we propose to continue the effort about bike sharing system description by
attempting to predict the bike availability rates for each station in Lyon.

* Collecting the data

As in the previous article we can use almost two months and a half of recordings at
every bike sharing stations in Lyon, between 2017/07/08 and 2017/09/26.

By simplifying our data, we can see that we get timestamped bike availability
data at each station.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session openbike_pred :exports none
import sources.prediction as pred
import pandas as pd

raw = pd.read_csv("../data/lyon.csv", parse_dates=["last_update"])
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session openbike_pred :exports results
lyon = pred.cleanup(raw)
lyon.sample(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:          station                  ts  stands  bikes bonus
: 5466310     2002 2017-09-05 23:24:54      18      2   Non
: 6245383     5015 2017-09-13 18:32:57       5     14   Non
: 7074115    11003 2017-09-22 02:49:36       2     18   Non
: 5748741     8008 2017-09-08 19:16:41       3     10   Non
: 3372882     6020 2017-08-16 01:29:05       2     13   Non

We preprocess a little bit more these data so as to extract timestamp
features and the probability to find a bike at each period of the day. Here
data is resampled to 10-minute periods, and the amount of available bikes is
averaged regarding records gathered during each period.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session openbike_pred :exports results
lyon = lyon.pipe(pred.time_resampling).pipe(pred.complete_data).pipe(pred.bikes_probability)
lyon.head(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:    station                  ts  bikes  stands  day  hour  minute  probability
: 0     1001 2017-07-09 00:00:00   15.0     1.0    6     0       0      0.93750
: 1     1001 2017-07-09 00:10:00   15.0     1.0    6     0       0      0.93750
: 2     1001 2017-07-09 00:20:00   14.5     1.5    6     0      10      0.90625
: 3     1001 2017-07-09 00:30:00   14.5     1.5    6     0      20      0.90625
: 4     1001 2017-07-09 00:40:00   11.5     4.5    6     0      30      0.71875

This is the final data set that we will give to the predictive model. To
improve the quality of predictions, other types of data could be integrated to
this framework, /e.g./ weather forecasts (however we let it for a further study).

* Predicting shared bike availability

The first practical question to answer here is the prediction horizon. Here we
will attempt to predict the bike availability after 30 minutes. It could be a
typical problem for a user who wants to plan a local trip: will he find a
bike at his preferred station, or should he walk to the next one? Or maybe
should he look for an alternative transportation mode, as there will be no bike in
the neighborhood nearby?

Let's use two weeks of data for training (/i.e./ from 2017/07/11 to 2017/07/25) so as
to predict one day of availability on the network (/i.e./ 2017/07/26). The
explicative variables will be the station id, the timestamp information (day
id, hours, minutes) and the station-related features (numbers of available
bikes and stands).

To do the hard prediction job, we use [[https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost][XGBoost]] (see doc [[http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][here]]), a distributed
gradient boosting method that can undertake classification as well as
regression processes. Here, we are in the second case, as we want to estimate
the value of a quantitative variable (the probability of finding an available
bike at a given station, at a given hour).

As the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost][Ada Boost]] model, XGBoost is a /boosted tree/ model which involves a
sequence of smaller models (decision trees) and where each submodel training
error function depends on the previous model results. Boosting algorithms are
one of the most widely used algorithm in data science competitions.

Our model learns quite fast, and after 25 iterations, the training process
converges around a satisfying error value (around 0.095).

* Mapping the predictions

In the last article, we plotted the shared bike stations according to
their clusters. Here, we are in a regression problem, we are more focused on the
level of bike availability, seen as a percentage.

The following map shows such a quantity, for all stations in Lyon:

#+CAPTION: True shared bike availability, per station (red: empty station, blue: full station)
#+NAME: fig:lyon_ground_truth_availability
[[../images/lyon_groundtruth.png]]

We have to compare it with the prediction provided by the XGBoost model
below. With such a color scale, we can say that the prediction looks good:

#+NAME: fig:lyon_predicted_availability

If we focus on the prediction error, we may highlight bike stations where the
model failed to give an accurate prediction:

#+CAPTION: Prediction error (RMSE), per station (red: less bike than ground truth, blue: more bike than ground truth)
#+NAME: fig:lyon_prediction_error
[[../image/lyon_prediction_error.png]]

The wrong predictions are sparsely located, with the exception of three
stations on the west of the city. These points are on the Fourvière hill, a
very hard place to ride with bikes! As if the model were really unconfident
regarding people's ability to climb up to these stations...
