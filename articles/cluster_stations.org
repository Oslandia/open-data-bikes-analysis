[[http://oslandia.com/][Oslandia]] team is involved in a constant effort in geospatial data gathering and
analysis. By taking advantage of the recent trend in public open data
releasing, and after reading an inspiring work done by James Lawlor for [[https://towardsdatascience.com/usage-patterns-of-dublin-bikes-stations-484bdd9c5b9e][Dublin
data]], we decided to evaluate the situation in our own living places. Here comes
the open data portals for both cities: [[https://data.grandlyon.com/][Lyon]] and [[http://opendata.bordeaux.fr/][Bordeaux]].

* What is the data looking like?

Both data set have been gathered with a cron plugged onto open data portals to
get data every 5 minutes. The data of this study are between the 8th of July and
the 26th of September, /i.e./ more than 11 weeks of data.

It is important to consider there is no real standardization relatively to bike
sharing open data sets: each city provide its own data set with its own
features.

Around Lyon the data set is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session openbike :exports results
import pandas as pd
lyon = pd.read_csv("../data/lyon.csv", parse_dates=["last_update"])
lyon = lyon.sort_values(["number", "last_update"])
lyon.sample().T
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

status                                OPEN
#+end_example

Whereas for Bordeaux, a record is like:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session openbike :exports results
bordeaux = pd.read_csv("../data/bordeaux.csv", parse_dates=["ts"])
bordeaux.sample().T
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

However to investigate on bike availability patterns and provide clusters, we
only need station ids, timestamps and number of available bikes!

* Are there identifiable types of bike sharing stations?

In order to identify groups of similar bike sharing stations in each of these
cities, we have run a simple clustering approach on availability data. To keep
the data set as simple as possible and work on comparable situations, we have
agregated the measurement to one-hour periods, and dropped the data gathered
during week-end days. We consequently have dataframes of =N= rows and 24
columns (a column being the bike percentage of availability at every stations,
for a given hour of the day).

We have worked with four clusters, regarding elbow method as well as cluster
significance.

As showed by figures below, the global pattern seems comparable between both
cities:
+ a first cluster (red) groups stations where bikes have high availability
  rates during the night. They probably refer to residential neighborhoods.
+ a second cluster (green in Bordeaux, blue in Lyon) gathers stations near 
  diurnal activities (job places, universities and so on...)
+ a third cluster (blue in Bordeaux, green in Lyon) refers to stations where
  there are almost always a high proportion of available bikes. They are either
  in less visited places or other transportation mode do the job
+ a fourth and last group (purple) clusters stations where there are a lot of
  bikes during evenings, and fairly less during the remaining of the day,
  showing lively night-time neighborhoods

* Understand a city from its bike sharing stations

This can be considered quite good for a beginning, however what about the geographical part of
the data? [[https://github.com/python-visualization/folium][Folium]] (see doc [[https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][here]]), a Python library based on [[http://leafletjs.com][Leaflet.js]], will
allow us to draw interactive maps with our newly designed clusters.

The situation of both example cities is quite diverging here, as illustrated by
the previous maps. On the first hand, we can see that the Bordeaux spatial
repartition is not that clear following the clustering process. Either the
cluster process gives unsignificant results, or the shared bike usage does not
fit the neighborhood division.

On the second hand, results in Lyon are far more significant, from a
geospatial point of view. Residential stations are mainly in Villeurbanne (east of Lyon) 
and in the 8th district (south east). We get a high concentration of
blue stations (diurnal activities) in the 3rd district (Part-Dieu business
area), or near La Doua campus (north). It is interesting to point out
some blue points in the far south east of the city: they correspond to the largest
hospital in Lyon. If we consider purple stations (evening activities), almost all
the points are located in the city center (Croix-Rousse, Lyon peninsula and
riverbanks nearby), in partying places.

(... With all these elements, the true question is: where is Oslandia's office located in Lyon ?)



In a next article, we will provide an extension of this work by predicting bike
availability at stations.
